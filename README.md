# Chobble.com

This is the code behind the site at [chobble.com](https://chobble.com).

It's an Eleventy site, built with Github Actions, and hosted on Neocities

If you want a site like it, you'd be better served by cloning the [Chobble Template](https://chobble.com/services/chobble-template) - which is like this site but with a load of cool bells and whistles to make it easy for small businesses to get up and running
