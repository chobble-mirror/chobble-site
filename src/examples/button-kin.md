# Indie Games Studio Website

- **Client:** Button Kin Games
- **Services:** Website design and hosting
- **Website:** [ButtonKin.com](https://buttonkin.com)
- **Source code:** [on git.chobble.com](https://git.chobble.com/hosted-by-chobble/buttonkin)

Button Kin is an indie tabletop roleplaying games studio that operates from the same Prestwich building as Chobble - because my wife runs it from our home!

It's a static website - edited through simple text files - with a blog, listings of games and adventures, links through to buy the games, and connections to social media sites.

## Techie Speccies

- It's an **Eleventy** website ([11ty.dev](https://www.11ty.dev/)) - a fast, customisable framework using JavaScript.
- It is loosely based on the **[Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/)** with plenty of customisations. This meant we get some nice things out of the box, like RSS feeds, Sitemaps, and responsive images.
- The site is automatically re-built and re-deployed whenever its source code is modified, using **Forgejo Actions**.
- It is hosted on **Neocities** ([neocities.org/site/buttonkin](https://neocities.org/site/buttonkin)) - the perfect home for a quirky, indie website.
- It collects subscriptions to a **Buttondown newsletter** list.
- It gets near-perfect **Lighthouse scores** - Google's system for determining how fast, accessible, and search engine friendly a website is.

## How much did it cost?

This site was **free**, because it was for my wife and I love her very much!

If you're not my wife and you want a similar site for your own indie games studio you'd qualify for my **50% discounted** rate (see [prices](/prices/)) as an artist. Depending on how much customisation you want the site would take between three and ten hours, meaning a price somewhere **between £300 and £1,000**.

Because the code to this site is **open source** and released under the copyleft AGPLv3 license, you could modify it as much as you like yourself, at no cost. Or you can build the whole site yourself using the code as a template! The link to the source is [here](https://git.chobble.com/hosted-by-chobble/buttonkin) - knock yourself out!

You could host the site for free if you used something like Github Pages or Netlify, or you could host with me for **£20/month** and I'll handle backups and monitoring, and give you free [SEO advice](/services/patreon/) too.

## Let's do it!

Alright - glad to have convinced you! [Contact me via your preferred method](/contact/) to get the ball rolling. I take 50% payment up front and 50% on completion, and I can probably get started pretty quickly.
