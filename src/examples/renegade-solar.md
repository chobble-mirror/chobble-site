I built a fast, accessible site for Ashley at Renegade Solar, replacing their old Wix site with something much better while actually saving them money on the monthly costs.

## My Solution

I took what worked from their old Wix site and built a new Eleventy site that's much faster and easier to manage. The site has all the info potential customers need - services, accreditations, and location-specific pages for different areas in the North West - but loads in a fraction of the time.

The contact form uses FormSpark with BotPoison spam protection, giving Ashley a reliable way to receive enquiries without the monthly costs of premium Wix forms. Since he's in renewable energy, I've halved his monthly hosting costs to just Â£20 - cheaper than what he was paying for Wix.

## Technical Details

The site is built with Eleventy, giving it perfect Lighthouse performance scores and great mobile responsiveness. It's designed to rank well in specific locations around the North West where Ashley wants to target customers.

I track his search positions with SerpBear, monitoring how he ranks for his target keywords in various locations across the North West. This data helps us refine his content strategy and identify new opportunities.

## Ongoing Support

Ashley gets free access to my marketing advice Patreon as part of his package. I help him maintain a consistent, professional online presence across his website and social channels. We regularly discuss which areas to target next and how to adjust his messaging for different customer types.

Beyond just technical support, I advise him on his broader marketing approach - from the tone of his content to how he presents his business to different types of customers.

## Results

The new site gets significantly more traffic than his old Wix site ever did. It always loads in under a second and gets perfect scores in Lighthouse performance tests.

He's now ranking on the first page for several valuable search terms in his target locations, bringing in consistent leads. And all this while actually reducing his monthly costs compared to Wix.

## Source Code

The complete source code for this project is available [on my Git forge](https://git.chobble.com/hosted-by-chobble/renegade-solar). This means Ashley owns his website for life rather than renting one from Wix. Anyone can build on this codebase in the future, and if I get hit by a bus, he won't lose anything - unlike with proprietary website builders.
