# About Chobble

Chobble is me, Stef, from Prestwich, Manchester - a web and software developer with over 20 years of experience working on websites of all sizes - from small local charities and social groups to massive international storefronts.

I started Chobble to:

- Build websites and tools for local organisations and individuals
- Provide honest advice and guidance
- Contribute to the wider open source community

I charge a [flat per-hour rate](/prices/) and give full details of what's included.

I prefer solutions which empower their users and so prioritise open source and flexibility over proprietary or locked-in solutions.

I do not force you to host with me and provide instructions for hosting elsewhere or moving away - although you might like to host with me anyway.

I are happy to explain as much about how your website works as you like, and will share all of its source code by default.

I know many other tech-adjacent people (eg designers, copywriters, marketers) and are happy to connect you to them if you need their services.

If this sounds good, please [contact me](/contact/) to discuss your project!
