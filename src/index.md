**I'm Stef, a web and software developer for over 20 years, based in Prestwich, Manchester.**

I can help you succeed online by demystifying websites, hosting, online marketing, and tech in general.

Everything I do is released as "open source" ([here's my source code](https://git.chobble.com)) with no contract or obligations. You don't have to pay any monthly fees and can host wherever you like - although you might choose to pay to host with me.

I have [very transparent and honest pricing](/prices/) with a flat hourly rate.

My rate is **discounted 50% for charities, co-operatives and sustainable businesses.**

I am flexible and up for discussing anything.
