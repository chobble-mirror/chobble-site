# Wix Site Edits

If you've already got a [Wix](https://www.wix.com) website and are mostly happy with it, Chobble can help you improve it further.

Wix's editor has a tonne of advanced technical functionality but using it can be overwhelming to non-technical users.

Our decades of experience working with similarly complex systems means we can help you use the advanced features to provide a richer experience to site visitors. We'll read Wix's technical documentation and work with you to develop a site improvement plan.

You'll still be tied into the Wix ecosystem and prices, and you might prefer to have a fresh and fast [static website](/services/static-websites/) built instead (perhaps via a [website migration](/services/website-migrations/)) with code which you fully control and can host anywhere, but we won't pressure you to change.

We can use Wix's editor to:

- Set up an online store
- Take online bookings
- Create a members-only area
- Populate a site from a product database
- Create video, photo, or music galleries
- Add animations

And loads more! [Check out the Wix documentation](https://dev.wix.com/) for an idea of its functionality.

We'll fully explain the changes we've made to give you an insight into how the new functionality works.

So, if you've got a Wix website and need a bit of help making the most of it, please [contact us](/contact)!
