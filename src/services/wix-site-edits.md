# I Can Edit Your Wix Site

While I prefer to create [websites from scratch](/services/static-websites), if you've got a **Wix website** and are generally happy with it but want to tweak it, I'm happy to help.

Wix's editor has a _tonne_ of advanced technical functionality but making the most of these can be overwhelming to non-technical users, and it's easy to get lost in the interface.

My decades of experience working with similarly complex systems means I can help you use Wix's trickier features to help make your site more engaging for visitors. I'll read Wix's technical documentation and quote once I've fully understood the job. And like all other work, I'll explain exactly what I did.

I can use Wix's editor to:

- Set up an **online store** using Wix eCommerce
- Take online bookings with Wix Scheduling
- Create a members-only area using Permissions
- Populate a site from a product database
- Create video, photo, or music galleries
- Add animations

And loads more! [Check out the Wix documentation](https://dev.wix.com/) for an idea of its functionality.

## For Prestwichians

If you're local to Prestwich and want to sit together with me to pick my brains about Wix, I'm happy to meet up at a place that suits you.

## Prices for Wix Edits

I aim to be transparent with my [pricing](/prices/) and will only quote once I have understood the scope of the project and the tools we will use. Straightforward text or CSS edits will probably take an hour max, while bigger projects like booking systems, videos, or databases will be longer.

**So, if you've got a Wix website and need a bit of help making the most of it, please [contact me](/contact/)!**
