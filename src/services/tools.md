# Tools

I've made a few different widgets and tools over the years. Many have been lost to the sands of time, but here's some links to things that remain.

## Portable Appliance Test Logger

- **[patlog.co.uk](https://patlog.co.uk)**

> "Portable appliance testing (PAT inspection or PAT testing) is a process by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety." [~Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_appliance_testing)

I made a simple, free website where users can log PAT tests with accompanying PDF certificates and QR code links. It also explains that PAT tests might not be necessary on its 'about' page.

## Checkatrade Review Scraper

- **[/tools/checkatrade-reviews](/tools/checkatrade-reviews)**

There's no straightforward way to export reviews from Checkatrade, so I built a tool to do it. You might use these in your static site, or to analyse them, or whatevs - it's your data, so you should be able to use it.
