# Nextcloud Document Management

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is an online document storage and management system, like Google Docs or Dropbox. It lets you sync your files between devices, browse your media, share your files with others, edit some document types, store music, and other file management type jobs.

But unlike Google's version, Nextcloud is open source and can be hosted on a server you can control yourself and sync your devices to, which makes it:

- **Private:** You can store your files on a server and country with strong privacy safeguards.
- **Flexible:** Nextcloud has tonnes of plugins you can enable to bolt on new functionality (finances, media, etc)
- **Affordable:** You can create a server with exactly as much or as little resources as you need and expand when needed. 

_Note: Nextcloud doesn't do EVERYTHING that Google Docs does - it doesn't have as nice of a text editor and there's no spreadsheet tool, for example._

I've used Nextcloud / Owncloud for nearly 15 years and am happy to advise you about switching over. I can help you get set up with your own Nextcloud installation with [Hetzner StorageShare](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-share/) or a host of your choice.

You'll get full administrative access so you can create as many users as you like and manage plugins ("apps").

I'll go through the settings with you and show you around your new document management system, and you can reference [the Nextcloud documentation](https://nextcloud.com/support/) too.

## Pricing

I bill by the hour, and setting up a Nextcloud installation, using Hetzner servers, and connecting to a custom domain takes about [two hours](/prices/).

You'll set up a monthly recurring charge to the web host, which can be as cheap as Â£2 per month for a small server.

**If you want to switch away from Google for storing your documents, Nextcloud is be a great way to take control. [Contact me to get the ball rolling!](/contact/)**
