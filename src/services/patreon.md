# Online Marketing Advice Club

Trying to get your head around terms like "SEO", "link building", "keywords" or "SERPs" can be overwhelming, and might dissuade you from going "all in" on promoting your website.

I've started the [Chobble marketing advice club](https://www.patreon.com/Chobble) on Patreon.com to provide weekly tips on search engine optimisation, online marketing, and website maintenance specifically for UK small businesses.

For **£20 per month** you will get full access to past and future posts and videos, live streams, and any other ways I use the platform. And if you pay me to host a website for you, you'll get **free** access for a year!

## What's Included

- **Weekly actionable tips** that you can implement straight away
- **Detailed guides** on SEO, content creation, and local marketing
- **Real-world examples** from businesses I've helped
- **British-focused advice** (not American marketing that doesn't work here)
- **No-nonsense explanations** in plain English without the jargon
- **Direct access** to me for questions about your specific situation
- **No spammy techniques** that could get your site penalised

## Recent Topics Covered

Here's a sample of what members have been learning about:

- [Keywords & Keyword Stuffing](https://www.patreon.com/posts/keyword-keyword-121654491) - How to use keywords effectively without overdoing it
- [Backlinks](https://www.patreon.com/posts/backlinks-120218288) - Finding quality links from reputable sources

- [Using AI Effectively](https://www.patreon.com/posts/using-ai-120755818) - How to use AI tools without hurting your site's credibility

Each guide is written specifically for UK businesses, with practical advice that works in our market. I focus on techniques that are sustainable long-term and won't get your site penalised when Google updates its algorithms.

## Who Is This For?

This club is perfect for:

- Small business owners who want more enquiries from their website
- People who are willing to put in a bit of work but need direction
- Anyone who wants to understand online marketing without the fluff
- UK-based businesses looking for advice that works in our market
- Folks who might have tried random tips from YouTube with little success

As a full-time nerd who has been helping businesses improve their online presence for decades, I can help you make the most of the time you spend working on your web presence.

## The Chobble Approach to Marketing

I believe in honest, sustainable marketing that prioritises providing real value to your visitors. I will never tell you to:

- Stuff keywords into your content unnaturally
- Buy dodgy backlinks that could harm your site
- Use manipulative techniques that will eventually backfire
- Waste money on services that don't deliver results

Instead, I focus on helping you understand what your customers are actually looking for, and how to provide that to them in a way that Google will recognise and reward.

## How It Works

There is no contract or other obligations. You don't have to have a website from me, or use any specific provider - you just need to be able to create and edit pages on your existing website, and to be able to dedicate a bit of time to the process.

Whether you're based in Prestwich or anywhere else in the UK, I'm sure I can help, regardless of your industry.
