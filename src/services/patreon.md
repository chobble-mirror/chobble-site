# Online Marketing Advice Club

If you've already got a website you may wonder how to best attract visitors and turn them into paying customers.

I've started the Chobble [marketing advice club](https://www.patreon.com/Chobble) on Patreon.com to provide weekly tips on search engine optimisation and online marketing.

For **£20 per month** you will get full access to these tips, alongside occasional Q&A sessions and live streams.

As a full-time nerd who has been working to help businesses succeed online for decades I have a wealth of knowledge on the subject and can help you make the most of the time you spend working on your web presence.

I will never tell you to do anything spammy or dangerous - just simple, straightforward tips to improve your content, provide value to visitors, and get your website in front of more potential customers.

Whether you're based in Prestwich or anywhere else in the UK, I'm sure I can help, whatever your industry.

There is no contract or other obligations. You don't have to have a website from me, or use any specific provider - you just need to be able to create and edit pages on your existing website, and to be able to dedicate a bit of time to the process.
