# Online Marketing Advice Club

If you've already got a website you may wonder how to best attract visitors and turn them into paying customers.

I've started the Chobble [marketing advice club](https://www.patreon.com/Chobble) on Patreon.com to provide weekly tips on search engine optimisation and online marketing.

For **£20 per month** you will get full access to past and future posts, videos I make, live streams I host, and any other ways I use the platform. And if you pay me to host a website for you, you'll get **free** access!

As a full-time nerd who has been working to help direct customers to websites for decades I have a wealth of knowledge on the subject and can help you make the most of the time you spend working on your web presence.

I will never tell you to do anything spammy or dangerous - just simple, straightforward tips to improve your content, provide value to visitors, and get your website in front of more potential customers.

To give you an idea of content - recent posts have included: [Keywords & Keyword Stuffing](https://www.patreon.com/posts/keyword-keyword-121654491), [Backlinks](https://www.patreon.com/posts/backlinks-120218288), [Targeting Local Areas](https://www.patreon.com/posts/targeting-local-119714736) and [Using AI Effectively](https://www.patreon.com/posts/using-ai-120755818?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_fan&utm_content=web_share).

Whether you're based in Prestwich or anywhere else in the UK, I'm sure I can help, regardless of your industry.

There is no contract or other obligations. You don't have to have a website from me, or use any specific provider - you just need to be able to create and edit pages on your existing website, and to be able to dedicate a bit of time to the process.
