# Vegan Business Websites

**Get 50% off if you run a vegan business.** That's £100/hour instead of £200/hour, meaning a simple restaurant website design could be as little as **£300**.

My prices are 100% transparent - check out my [price calculator](/price-calculator/). For just **£20/month** to host unlimited vegan static websites with me, you'll also get free access to my [marketing advice Patreon group](/services/patreon/) for up-to-date advice on promoting your new website.

I've been vegan for 15+ years and vegetarian my whole life, so I'm personally invested in helping vegan businesses succeed - your success means a better planet for all. I'll help you put your values front and centre to attract visitors searching Google for ethical options.

## Proven track record

**[Sally's Bakes](/examples/sallys-bakes)** in Bury got a site with clear ingredient lists, perfect Lighthouse scores, HappyCow integration, and simple self-maintenance.

**[Southport Organics](/examples/southport-organics)** aim to avoid Etsy fees with their own direct sales site, complete with easy product management and full ownership of their newsletter setup.

**[Vegan Prestwich](/examples/vegan-prestwich)**, the community platform I run, has grown to 800+ Facebook members and 500+ Instagram followers. We helped convince Joseph Holts to make their beers vegan!

## Real SEO results

My vegan clients do great on local searches:

- Sally's Bakes ranks #1 for "Vegan Baker Bury"
- This & That sits at #4-5 for "Vegan Curry Manchester"
- Vegan Prestwich is #1 for "Vegan Prestwich"

I use Google Search Console, SerpBear results tracking, Lighthouse audits and years of experience to make sure Google fully understands your site and properly focuses each page towards a specific "vegan" search term. Straightforward, mobile-friendly designs ensure your customers find the information they need quick sharp, reducing "bounce" rates.

## Easy to edit vegan websites

My [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/) website builder system makes it really easy to display full ingredient lists, allergen information, and obvious vegan labeling. You'll update everything yourself through the awesome "Pages CMS" editor ([pagescms.org](https://pagescms.org)) - and I'm always just a WhatsApp message away if you get stuck.

## How it works

First, we'll have a free chat about what you need. Then I'll give you a clear quote. Most sites are done within a week, and you'll own everything - I use open source technology so you'll have full control of your source code rather than "renting" access like many web providers.

## Questions?

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I qualify for the vegan discount?</strong></summary>

If your business is primarily vegan or has a significant vegan focus, you qualify. This includes 100% vegan businesses, vegetarian businesses with strong vegan options, businesses transitioning to veganism, or vegan product lines within larger businesses. Not sure? Just ask!

<summary><strong>What if I'm just starting out?</strong></summary>

Perfect! Getting your website right from the start saves money long-term. I'll help you choose the right domain, set up professional email, and build something that grows with you.

<summary><strong>Can you help with social media too?</strong></summary>

My expertise is websites, but through Vegan Prestwich I've learned what works on social. I'll share what I know, and my wife (who runs our Instagram) might have tips too.
