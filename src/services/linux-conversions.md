# Linux Conversions in Prestwich & Manchester

**Is your Windows PC running slow? Tired of Microsoft's bloatware and endless annoying updates? I can convert your laptop or desktop to Linux and give it new life.**

Based in Prestwich, I travel across Greater Manchester helping people escape Windows frustrations with fast, reliable Linux installations.

## Why Switch to Linux?

Most people come to me because their Windows machine has "gone slow" - usually because **Windows is bloated software** that struggles on budget PCs and older hardware, or because **resource-heavy drivers** from printers and scanners are constantly running in the background hogging CPU. Lately I'm also seeing people frustrated that **Windows 11 won't run** on their perfectly good but "unsupported" machine, plus growing **privacy concerns** about Microsoft's data collection and ads.

Linux is people-centred rather than profit-centred. It's faster, more straightforward, and doesn't treat you like a product to monetise.

## Success Stories

I've breathed new life into machines that Windows had written off. One friend's **10+ year old media center PC** was gathering dust until I installed Ubuntu - now it's perfect for emails and web browsing and has been running happily for years. I helped a **parish council office migration** by switching them to Ubuntu with Nextcloud backups, saving them ongoing Microsoft licensing costs. I've also done **web server conversions** for local organizations like [Blue Pits](https://bluepitshousingaction.co.uk), migrating them from expensive Windows hosting to Linux static sites and **saving them Â£25+ monthly** in hosting costs.

## What I Can Help With

For **laptop and desktop conversions**, I typically do full Windows replacement with Ubuntu (recommended for beginners), handle data migration from whatever software you're currently using, and check hardware compatibility with advice on printer/scanner support. My turnaround is quick - usually 1-2 days maximum.

I also offer **advanced Linux services** like **NixOS installations** for technically adventurous users (I use it myself - see [my blog](https://blog.chobble.com/blog/)), **web server migrations** from Windows to Linux hosting, and **dual-boot setups** (though I recommend full conversion where possible). I'm happy to help with custom configurations and ongoing support.

I collect and deliver throughout North Manchester - Prestwich, Bury, Whitefield, Radcliffe, and across the wider Manchester area. There's need to travel to me unless you're outside the region.

## The Conversion Process

My process is straightforward: I start with **data backup** to preserve all your documents, photos, and important files, then do the **Ubuntu installation** as a complete Windows replacement with the latest Long Term Support version. Next comes **software setup** where I install free alternatives to your existing programs and Firefox with ad-blocking built in. I follow up with **hardware testing** to ensure everything works properly before handover, and finish with **basic training** to show you the essentials so you can get started confidently.

## Honest Hardware Advice

Some older peripherals only work with Windows - if that's your situation, I'll help you find better, universally-compatible alternatives. Companies that make Windows-only drivers are usually rubbish anyway.

For unsupported hardware, I can recommend replacement options that work better with Linux and are often higher quality and more user-focused.

## Flexible Service & Pricing

I charge my standard [hourly rate](/prices/) with no packages or upselling. Need something specific? Want to learn about command line usage or server administration? I'm happy to figure out documentation together - my years of Linux experience make tackling new challenges straightforward.

If you're running a charity, co-operative, or sustainable business, you get 50% off my rates.
