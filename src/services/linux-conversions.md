# Linux Laptop Conversions in Prestwich

**Give your Windows machine a new lease of life by switching it over to Linux.**

## What is Linux?

Linux is a type of "operating system" (like Windows) for your computer. Unlike Windows - which exists to make profit for one company, Microsoft - Linux is free and is made with an "open" license by a huge community of people, with software that is built in similar collaborative ways.

You can install Ubuntu Linux on your laptop or PC and will probably find that it runs faster than Windows, is easy to use, doesn't have any adverts, is very customisable, and has all the free software you need.

I have installed Ubuntu dozens of times over the years and the process is very straightforward for me, but if it sounds daunting to you then you may be interested in my Linux Laptop Conversion service.

_I'm also happy to install any other Linux variant, set up a new laptop from scratch, advise you about your setup, or any other consultancy type of thing - [contact me](/contact/)_

## Linux Conversion Steps

1. **Back up your data to USB:** Let me know if you're storing files anywhere other than your Documents folder.

2. **Replace Windows with Ubuntu Linux:** I'll follow [this guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview) to create a bootable USB stick of Ubuntu, and use that to **delete your Windows partition** and **install Ubuntu** on the laptop instead.

3. **Install free apps:** There are probably [free and open source alternatives](https://gist.github.com/MMachado05/89ddebd8b28cbb648a5c2f574dc21338) to the expensive apps you previously used. Lets get them installed by following [this guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/addremove.html.en).

4. **Restore the backup:** I'll move the backed-up files back onto your laptop, into their new homes in Linux.
