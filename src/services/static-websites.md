# Static Website Development

Chobble builds fast, stable, and mobile-friendly websites using the 'Eleventy' or 'Jekyll' static site generators.

Some examples include [This & That Cafe](/examples/this-and-that), [Blue Pits](/examples/blue-pits) and [Vegan Prestwich](/examples/vegan-prestwich).

## What is a static website?

The site's contents can be edited through a simple admin interface or directly as text files on your computer.

Static site generators create sites with:

- High performance and stability
- Low or zero hosting costs
- Total flexibility
- Very easy to edit files

This makes them a great option for most business websites where the content changes less frequently and performance and directness is very important.

## How It Works

1. You choose a template or employ a designer
2. We build your website using Eleventy or Jekyll
3. Its content is stored in simple text files
4. You can edit the content yourself or send us changes
5. Backups are handled automatically
6. You get the full source code
