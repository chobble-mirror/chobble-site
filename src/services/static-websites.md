# Static Website Development

I build fast, stable, and mobile-friendly websites using the 'Eleventy' or 'Jekyll' static site generators.

**Some examples: [This & That Cafe](/examples/this-and-that), [Blue Pits](/examples/blue-pits) and [Vegan Prestwich](/examples/vegan-prestwich).**

## What is a static website?

The site's contents can be edited through a simple admin interface or directly as text files on your computer.

Static site generators create sites with:

- High performance and stability
- Low or zero hosting costs
- Total flexibility
- Very easy to edit files

This makes them a great option for most business websites where the content changes less frequently and performance and clarity is very important.

## How It Works

1. You choose a template or employ a designer
2. I build your website using Eleventy or Jekyll
3. Its content is stored in simple text files
4. You can edit the content yourself or send me changes
5. Backups are handled automatically
6. You get the full source code

## Prices

I will provide estimates and charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/). Here are some rough estimates for the stages of the process of building a static website:

- **2 hours: Base setup**
  - Creating an empty site
  - Backing it up via Git
  - Adding a CMS
  - Inviting you to the CMS
  - Auto-publishing to your static host of choice
- **1-6 hours: Base template**
  - Cloning an existing template and updating its text to fit your business, or creating a new template from scratch
- **1-4 hours: Images**
  - Cropping / resizing your images, sourcing designers
- **1 hour: Domain names**
  - Pointing your domain to its new host
- **1 hour: Email setup**
  - Setting up email accounts with your host of choice
- **1-6 hours: Content**
  - Populating your site content, sourcing copywriters

Not all of these stages will be necessary for every site, and you might be able to do some yourself - and I'll be there to guide you if you do.
