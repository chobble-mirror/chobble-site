# Website Migrations

If you're happy with the look and contents of your existing website but you update it very infrequently, you might be paying for expensive dynamic hosting you don't need.

We can transform your website into an archived website using mirroring software so you can host it on low cost static website hosts that you control. The site will become an archived version of its former dynamic self, but to visitors it will appear just the same.

Making edits to this site might be slightly more difficult than editing your dynamic site, but if the edits are rare then this is probably still worth it.

We can even build a [static site generator](/services/static-websites/) around your archived site, making edits easier but still allowing for very low cost hosting options.

[Contact us](/contact/) if this sounds like a good fit for your site.
