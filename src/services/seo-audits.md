# Search Engine Optimisation Audits

With decades of experience helping sites rank well on Google, we know what works and what is a waste of effort.

We have worked for businesses of all sizes, from fresh startups with zero sales through to huge international ecommerce sites processing hundreds of millions of pounds in sales every year.

We can do an SEO audit of your existing website and give you a list of tasks to help improve your rankings and attract more visitors.

Like all of our services, we charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) and will tell you exactly what we will do for that hour. You can choose to employ as much or as little of our services as you like.

## Full Site SEO Audits

The services we can offer as **full site** audit could include:

- **1 hour: Automated scan of your site**
  - We'll use [Screamingfrog's SEO Spider tool](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) to produce a report from your site.
- **1 hour: Prioritising the scan output**
  - We'll formatting the raw scan output into prioritised items in easily understood, jargon-free language so you will know what needs doing most urgently.
- **1 hour: Backlink profile analysis**
  - We'll analyse the backlink profile of a website (maybe your competitor's?) and grade the quality of their links, to give you insight into places worth building links for your business.

## Single Keyword SEO Audits

We can also do specific **keyword audits** to help you improve your ranking for a specific term:

- **1 hour: Evaluating existing content**
  - We will read your existing page and give jargon-free instructions on how to improve its quality and relevance, which should boost it up search results.
- **2 hours: Evaluating your competition**
  - We will compare your site's performance for a given keyword to your competitor's, and explain where your site is falling short.

## Page Performance Audits

Both Google and potential customers like it when your site loads quickly, and [performant sites generate more sales](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/).

We can evaluate your site's performance using [Google's Lighthouse tool](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_(software)>) to discover ways you (or your website provider) can make your site faster and improve its conversion rate:

- **2 hours: Lighthouse evaluation**
  - We will scan your site with Lighthouse and explain the results in jargon-free language, for you or your provider to fix.
- **1 - 24 hours: Performance fixes**
  - If you have access to your site's source code we can _probably_ fix performance issues ourselves. We have decades of experience in making sites load quickly - even really complex ones.

## Ethics and Honesty

If your site does not need any improvements, we will tell you - and you won't be charged.

We do not guarantee improvements to search engine rankings and you should not trust anyone who does, but we know what works and we have a great track record of success.

We will never prioritise one customer over another - everyone pays the same [flat hourly fee](/prices/) and gets the same high quality of service.

If this sounds like a good fit for your website, please [contact us](/contact/) and we can get the ball rolling!
