# Technical Consultancy in Prestwich

I've been working with websites for over 20 years and have encountered all sorts of issues your business might be dealing with - whether that's fiddly technical jobs like setting up the DNS records for your domain name, or large scale projects like re-writing legacy systems or searching for performance optimisations.

I've also built my own computers since I was a young lad and can help you source parts or upgrades for your own machines.

I won't push you to use any particular solution or provider - just honest and transparent advice backed up by facts and figures.

## Areas Of Expertise

I am _not_ a cybersecurity expert and am not able to offer penetration testing or security audits - you should hire a professional for those jobs. But I can advise about any aspects of:

- Website hosting:
  - [Static website builders](/services/static-websites/)
  - WordPress, Django, and other open source CMS websites
  - Squarespace, [Wix](/services/wix-site-edits/) and other proprietary builders
  - Shopify and other ecommerce systems
  - Domains, emails, and other DNS jobs
  - Sourcing designers, copywriters, and other professionals
- Computer security and maintenance
  - Backups and updates
  - Operating systems
- Data backup strategies
- Open source alternatives
- Basic server administration
  - Package management
  - Automatic updates
- Development practices
  - Source code management
  
## Let's Chat!

Initial consultations are free and if I already know the answer to your question, I'll tell you - no charge. Otherwise, I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) for all jobs. We'll discuss how to make the most out of my time so you know exactly what you're getting.

**If you need advice about any of the above topics, or anything else related, [contact me](/contact/) and I'll try my best to help.**
