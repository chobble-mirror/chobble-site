# Freelance Eleventy Developer

**Looking for an experienced Eleventy developer to build a super-fast, affordable website?** I've been working with Eleventy for lots of projects and can help you harness its full potential for your business.

Eleventy ([11ty.dev](https://www.11ty.dev/)) is my static site generator of choice for creating websites that load really quickly, rank well in search engines, and can be hosted on easy to use hosts at very low cost. As an experienced Eleventy developer I can help whether you're building a brand new site or updating an existing one.

## How Chobble Can Help With Eleventy

<div class="card margins" id="building">

### Building New Eleventy Sites

I'll create a **custom Eleventy site** around your specific business needs.

Your site will have a **fast, mobile friendly design** with minimal CSS and JavaScript, making the most of modern browser features. It will have **automatically optimised images** (with my [custom image placeholder](https://blog.chobble.com/blog/25-04-16-adding-base64-image-backgrounds-to-eleventy-img/) script too).

**Pretty RSS feeds** will encourage subscribers, **sitemaps** increase page discoverability, and **built-in SEO features** like canonical and meta tags will help your site perform well with search engines.

The sites have **easy-to-update content** using plain text files or a simple CMS. **Default collections** like pages, news posts, products and galleries are configured, ready for you to edit. Sites have **secure contact forms** with automatic bot protection. You'll get the **full source code** with **clear documentation** to explain how everything works.

Whether you're starting from a template like my [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/) or need something built from scratch, I'll deliver a site that's super easy to maintain and always loads quickly.

### Adding Features to Existing Eleventy Sites

If you've already got an Eleventy site (awesome, nice choice!) then I can help improve it.

I can implement **new page types** or content collections to expand your site's capabilities. Your site can showcase products with **beautiful image galleries** and product showcases that load quickly. I create **custom shortcodes** for special content blocks that make updating content easier. Need a blog? I'll set up **complete blog functionality** with tags and categories for organizing your content. I can integrate **third-party services** like payment processors, booking systems, and more. Your site could benefit from **improved performance** and search engine visibility through technical optimisations. I can add **interactive elements** with vanilla JavaScript that enhance user experience without slowing down your site.

My changes will integrate seamlessly with your existing codebase while maintaining Eleventy's excellent performance.

### Converting CMS Sites to Eleventy

If you're stuck with an expensive, confusing, bulky or slow CMS website, I can help you migrate to Eleventy.

I can **transform your WordPress, Wix, Squarespace** or other sites into a tidy and minimalist Eleventy site. Your site will **keep its existing design** and content while improving performance. I'll set up **simple editing tools** that match your technical comfort level. You'll **reduce or eliminate ongoing hosting costs** by moving to more affordable static hosting options. Your site will **keep all the features you love** without the bloat you don't need.

**A real example:** I recently converted [A&S Home Furnishings](/examples/as-home-furnishings) from an expensive, broken CMS to a streamlined Eleventy site. I used `wget` to archive the existing site, converted the pages to Markdown, and implemented a fresh, responsive design. The new site loads instantly, has a working contact form, and costs just Â£10/month to host.

## Why Eleventy?

I've used a bunch of static site generators and CMS platforms over my years nerding, and have settled on Eleventy as my preferred option for small business websites, for a few reasons:

**JavaScript-based and beginner-friendly.** Eleventy uses JavaScript, which is easier for beginners to understand than other programming languages. This means more autonomy over your website - if I get hit by a bus, you'll find it easier to maintain or modify your site yourself or find another developer.

**NPM package management.** Eleventy uses npm, a fast and reliable package manager that's easier to run than alternatives like Ruby gems, making development and maintenance simpler.

**Highly extensible.** I can build custom transforms, collections, or use different formats for layouts to perfectly match your business needs. This flexibility allows your site to grow with your business.

**Perfect for most small businesses.** Most small business websites are essentially glorified brochures that rarely change, which static site generators are perfect for. My [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/) even supports product listings and Stripe checkouts, for sites that don't need live stock tracking.

**Flexible content management.** You can store your content in Markdown, JSON, HTML, or it can even be automatically generated from an API - whatever works best for your business.

**Future-proof technology.** Eleventy outputs standard web code that will continue to work for decades, unlike proprietary platforms that might change prices, remove features, or disappear.

**Affordable hosting options.** Static sites can be hosted for free or very cheaply on services like Neocities, , or Cloudflare Pages.

**Excellent SEO potential.** Fast-loading, semantically structured pages rank better in search results.

## My Eleventy Approach

I build Eleventy sites with a focus on:

- **Semantic HTML** that's accessible and SEO-friendly
- **Minimal, efficient CSS** for fast loading times
- **Progressive enhancement** so your site works for everyone
- **Maintainable code** you can understand and update
- **Clear documentation** of how everything works

Each site I build comes with full source code access and guidance on how to maintain and update your site yourself if you choose to.

## Prices for Eleventy Development

Like all my services, I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) for Eleventy development, with transparent estimates and regular updates. [I've built a price calculator which you can use to get an estimate of an Eleventy site build](/price-calculator/).

## Learn Eleventy Yourself

Want to take control of your own Eleventy site? I offer [technical training and tutoring](/services/technical-advice/) to help you learn how to:

- Understand the basics of Eleventy's template system
- Create and edit content using Markdown
- Add new pages and sections to your site
- Customize designs and layouts
- Deploy updates to your hosting provider

Training sessions can be conducted in person (if you're in Prestwich) or remotely, and are tailored to your current knowledge level and learning goals.
