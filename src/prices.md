# My Prices

I believe in transparent pricing. My flat rate is **£200 per hour** (charged in half-hour increments), and initial consultations are free.

My rate is **discounted 50%** at **£100 per hour** for:

- Charities and co-operatives
- Musicians, artists, and writers
- Vegan businesses
- Renewable energy businesses

I sometimes work for free, at my discretion.

## Service Charges (Static Sites)

You can host as many static websites as you like with me for **£40** per month, or **£20 if discounted**. For this fee we will:

- Host your sites
- Back up your sites
- Provide a content management system
- Host your DNS records
- Make any small changes you request
- Provide technical and marketing advice

You may choose to host elsewhere since you will have the full source code - that's totally fine. I recommend and support [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Neocities](https://neocities.org) and [Surge](https://surge.sh).

## Service Charges (Dynamic Sites)

I will host your Ruby on Rails dynamic site on its own server running NixOS. I will use the most affordable Gandi VPS server possible, starting at around £5 per month.

I will charge **£60** per month (or **£30 if discounted**) on top of whatever that hosting cost is. You will have full access to the server and its configuration. For this price we will:

- Host your service
- Back up your code
- Back up your database every day
- Provide your DNS records
- Make any small changes you request
- Provide technical advice

You can also host the site yourself, as you will have the full source code.

## Emails and Domain Renewals

I will help you source the ideal provider for your needs and budget. You will register and pay them directly, unless you _really_ don't want to, in which case we can sort something out.

## Other Open Source Software

If you want to host [Nextcloud](/services/de-googling/) for shared documents for your team, or a Mastodon server for your club, or you ned advice about any other software - we will help. And if you want to manage the server yourself and use me as a local consultant, that's totally fine.
