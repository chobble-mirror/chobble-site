# Web Design & Technology Services

You can hire me to make an entirely new website, improve an existing one, help you set up a server, advise you about search engine optimisation and online marketing, get my input on a techy decision at your job, or maybe write totally bespoke web software for you.

In any case you'll get the benefit of my decades of experience building and maintaining web software for businesses of all sizes.

## My Principles

**Transparent:** I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) for all jobs. I will break down each job by hour so you know exactly what you're getting.

**Open:** I'll give you full edit access to the code I write and explain how all it works, so you'll _own_ the source code of your project rather than "renting" access to the result.

**Affordable:** I prefer open source, low cost, and widely-compatible software over proprietary and locked-down systems. You can host anywhere - or pay me and get free SEO advice included.

**Accessible & performant:** I choose accessible solutions which allow visually-impaired users to browse your site, and I make performant sites which are easy to use on all devices.

## Some Services
