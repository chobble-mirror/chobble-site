# Web Design & Technology Services

You can hire me to make an [entirely new website](/services/static-websites/), improve an existing one, help you [set up a server](/services/technical-advice/), advise you about [search engine optimisation](/services/seo-audits/) and [online marketing](/services/patreon/), get my input on a techy decision at your job, or maybe write totally bespoke web software for you.

In any case you'll get the benefit of my decades of experience building and maintaining web software for businesses of all sizes, with a commitment to honesty and straightforwardness.

## My Principles

**Transparent:** I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) for all jobs. I will break down each job by hour so you know exactly what you're getting.

**Open source:** I'll give you full edit access to the code I write and explain how all it works - you'll _own_ your project rather than _renting_ access to it.

**Affordable:** I prefer low cost and widely-compatible tools over proprietary and locked-down systems. You can host anywhere - or pay me and get free marketing advice included.

**Accessible & performant:** I choose accessible systems which allow visually-impaired users to browse your site, and I make performant sites which are easy to use on all devices.

## Services

I'm up for [discussing anything you think I can help you with](/contact/) - but here are some of the main services you may be interested in:
