# Search Engine Optimisation in Prestwich

After 20+ years of hosting websites online I've become very familiar with what Google likes to see - fast, easy-to-use websites that organise their information neatly, and which use keywords effectively without ever tipping over into spammy territory.

For Prestwich businesses looking for SEO specialists I can either:

- Offer **tailored SEO advice** to you about how you can improve your website, build backlinks, and improve performance. You'll do the work and make the changes, and I'll mentor you, check your work, and give you guidance.

- Or the much more expensive option - **do those changes myself.**

I strongly advise the first option - learning about how to improve your web presence to attract more Prestwichians to click does not require any particular technical skills, and will mean you can keep gradually improving your site without any escalating charges.

## Can You Guarantee High Rankings?

No SEO expert should "guarantee" you a particular search ranking position. We do not have insights into Google's secret algorithms and rankings are determined from so many factors outside of an SEO company's control that the only ways to "guarantee" rankings are spammy short-term ones that risk getting your site blocked entirely, like paying for links, fake social media engagement, or outright sabotaging your competition.

Ethical "Search Engine Optimisation" companies should be clear that attaining and keeping top search engine positions is a long-term process which requires continuous work and evaluation.

That said, I've had some great SEO successes in some competitive areas, and am happy to share this knowledge with Prestwich businesses. Here are some recent Google rankings I've helped local businesses achieve _(accurate Feb 2025)_:

- [This & That cafe](/examples/this-and-that)
  - 3rd for "Curry Manchester" (after TripAdvisor and Reddit)
  - 4th for "Vegan Curry Manchester" (despite not being fully vegan)
- [Vegan Prestwich](/examples/vegan-prestwich)
  - 1st for "Vegan Prestwich"
  - 3rd for "Vegan Whitefield"
- [Renegade Solar](/examples/renegade-solar)
  - 2nd for "Solar Panel installer Prestwich"
- Sally's Bakes
  - 1st for "Vegan Baker Bury"
