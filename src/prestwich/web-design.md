# Web Design in Prestwich

As a fellow Prestwichian, I can visit you at your location, you can come to mine, or we can meet at a local cafe or bar to discuss your web design requirements (I'll have a Shindigger at Cuckoo, please!).

I pride myself on building fast, efficient, accessible and easily-understood websites - ideal for guiding visitors from search engines to the important information as quickly as possible.

Want a more complex, more visual website with lots going on? I'm happy to help with that too - I can source designers, turn paid-for templates into interactive sites, or build any advanced functionality with Ruby on Rails or other open source platforms.

My aim is to build local partnerships with organisations and individuals around Prestwich and to become known as a useful and honest web consultant.

## Transparent & Open Pricing

I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) for all jobs and will be very transparent about what is involved in each hour.

Unlike many web agencies I will also give you the **full source code** to your website, as well as **complete instructions** to allow you to re-build the site or to host wherever you like.

I offer affordable web hosting with full search engine optimisation guidance via [a free subscription to my Patreon marketing group](/services/patreon/), or you can host your site with a host like Cloudflare pages for no monthly cost at all.

Check out some of the [example websites](/examples/) listed on this site, or [contact me](/contact/) if you want to get planning your new website!
